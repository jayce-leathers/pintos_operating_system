# pintos_operating_system
Work by Tim Brown and Jayce Rudig-Leathers Spring 2016 at Vassar College in CS-334 Operating Systems taught by Jason Waterman

Pintos is the same operating used by Stanford in their [CS140 course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html). We have implemented process scheduling by means of a priority scheduler with priority donation to avoid starvation. We have also implemented user programs including the system calls. It will pass (most of) both sets of included tests.
