Added to struct thread:
  struct lock sleep_lock; //sleep on this lock
  struct condition ready_to_wake; //waits on this condition until it wakes
  int waking_tick; //tick to wake at. set to system ticks + ticks to sleep for


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

A2:
  timer_sleep() first checks whether the number of ticks to sleep for is
  greater than 0. If not, it returns immediately. It then calculates the tick at which
  the thread should wake up, by adding ticks to start. This is stored in the thread's
  member variable waking_tick.

  At this point, interrupts are disabled because we are adding the thread to the sleep_list,
  a bit of shared state between the kernel thread and the timer interrupt handler. Once
  disabled, the thread is inserted into the sleep_list. The thread then blocks via a call
  to thread_block. The thread will wait to be awoken by the timer interrupt handler, which
  at each tick will check each thread on the sleep list to see if their waiting_tick value
  is greater than the total ticks in the system. Once this happens, the thread is unblocked,
  placing it on the ready list, and removed from the sleep list.

A3:
  By storing the tick at which the thread should wake, there is a simple comparison
  check that must be made for each sleeping thread at each tick. If we hadn't stored this
  information, and instead just stored the number of ticks that the thread was required to
  sleep for, additional operations would be required to calculate whether the thread was
  ready to wake.

  An additional optimization we could make would be to insert threads into sleep_list in
  ascending order by number of ticks that they are required to sleep. This would have the
  benefit of not needing to traverse the entire list at every tick, because if the method
  encountered a thread that was not ready to wake, then necessarily the rest of the threads
  in the list would also not be ready to wake. This would add some complexity to the design,
  but might turn out to be necessary to reduce the amount of time spent in the timer interrupt
  handler.

             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid

              ADVANCED SCHEDULER
              ==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Suppose threads A, B, and C have nice values 0, 1, and 2.  Each
>> has a recent_cpu value of 0.  Fill in the table below showing the
>> scheduling decision and the priority and recent_cpu values for each
>> thread after each given number of timer ticks:

timer  recent_cpu    priority   thread

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code

>> C6: The assignment explains arithmetic for fixed-point math in

               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?
